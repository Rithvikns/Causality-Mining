📈 Granger Causality in Causality Mining
What is Granger Causality?
Granger Causality is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series can predict another. It's based on the premise that a variable X Granger-causes Y if past values of X contain information that helps predict Y beyond what is possible using only past values of Y.

Important: Granger Causality does not imply true causality—only a predictive relationship.
